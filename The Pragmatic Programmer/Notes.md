# Build Knowledge Portfolio:
  ## Manage a konwledge portfolio is similar to manage a financial portfolio, we need to follow key points below:
  * **Invest regulary(the most important one): always be open to new knowledge and willing to learn, build such habit**
  * Diversify: Not only need to know exactly how the technology you are working with works, but also need to know some other technologies
  * Manage risks: Do not put all technical eggs in one basket, learn both risky but high reward, low-risk but loew-reward technology.
  * Buy low, sell high: learn an emerging technology before it becomes popular is hard but rewarding
  * Review and rebalance: Brush up on your own tech database regularyly
